      <h1>Question 1</h1>
      <p>
          The Nichols Arboretum, or "The Arb," is a 123-acre nature preserve near the University of Michigan. 
          It is famous for its diverse collection of native and exotic trees, the Peony Garden, and miles 
          of trails that wind down to the Huron River. It’s the perfect spot for a hike or a quiet study break.
